# choropleth_plow
This repository has been specifically made for a Medium article, on Plotly's Animated Choropleth maps.

If you'd like to run this code, simply download everything, and run the notebook "map_pipeline.ipynb".
It will assemble the geodataframe and prepare the choropleth map, along with explanations on the pertinent steps.
